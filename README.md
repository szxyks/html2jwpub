# html2jwpub

A simple tool I made to create publications.

## Usage
- Select a folder with html files and multimedia (the multimedia must be in a in a subfolder named with the same name as the html file)
- Insert publication info (MepsLanguageId, Symbol, Year and Name)
- Done. You should find a .jwpub file inside your folder
